libs created specifically for Sumec
> [!NOTE]  
> most of the libs are missing from here. they should be rewritten anyway, so it's not that bad

## Contents

[.\\UDPStuff\\](.\\UDPStuff\\)</br>
Lib that gives Sumec access to udp comms. mainly meant for debuging without cable connection.</br>
a rewrite is definetly needed. code breaks when conwerted into a class so it's as just functions now. would be usefull to add options for ip address, port, whether to create or connect to an ap, ap pass, and ap name.</br>
owned by Natani, complain there.

[.\\WiFiAPStuff\\](.\\WiFiAPStuff\\)</br>
A wrapper for the standard WiFi.h lib. makes it very to create or connect to an access point.</br>
owned by Natani, complain there.

> [!NOTE]  
> Both of these should probably get a rewrite at some point.
