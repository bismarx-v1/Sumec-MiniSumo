# Tests

> [!WARNING]  
> Everything here should be rewritten.

This folder should be used for tests of pieces of code or specific robot parts/functions</br>
ex. "ledTest" should blink with the test led on the pcb. this should be used for testing if the pcb died completely, or just something expensive.
