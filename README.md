# MiniSumo "SUMEC" Robot Project

## Description
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation about student-built MiniSumo robot "SUMEC". MiniSumo robots are small autonomous robots designed to compete in MiniSumo competitions, where they attempt to push their opponents out of a ring.
## Contents
- **-CODE-:** Contains the source code for the MiniSumo robot, including firmware for microcontrollers, sensor libraries, and control algorithms.
- **-DOCS-:** Includes robot documentation, rules for specific tournaments, and extras.
- **-3D-:** Provides CAD files for the mechanical components of the robot, such as the chassis and sensor mounts.
- **-PCB-:** Includes PCB files, we are using KiCAD for PCB designing.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Review the documentation to understand the components required and the assembly process.
3. Assemble the mechanical components of the robot according to the provided CAD files.
4. Set up the electronic components, including microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators.
5. Program the robot using the provided codebase or develop your own algorithms.
6. Test the robot in a controlled environment to ensure proper functionality.
7. Participate in MiniSumo competitions or challenge your friends to friendly matches!
